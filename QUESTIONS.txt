1. Write a ReactJS single page application that can be served as a static website (HTML CSS JS files, use whatever libraries you want) that requests this endpoint and shows the result according to the wireframe above.

2. We assume a SQL server that contains a table according to the following schema :

CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  team_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  manager_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

Create a small Ruby on Rails app that produces the API endpoint above.

3. Plug your frontend and backend together to confirm it works.

4. What tests would you write for this functionality?

5. Design and implement a way to add a user to this hierarchy.
